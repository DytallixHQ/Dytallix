# Dytallix Performance Baseline Report

**Generated:** 2025-07-26T00:40:36.970700+00:00  
**Environment:** macOS-15.5-arm64-arm-64bit  
**Test Configuration:** 60s duration, 10 concurrent requests

## Executive Summary

This report establishes performance baselines for all core Dytallix components to enable continuous performance monitoring and regression detection.

### Overall Performance Scores

- **Overall System Score**: 0.00/10.0

## Smart Contract Performance

*Smart contract metrics not available*

## WASM Runtime Performance

*WASM runtime metrics not available*

## AI API Performance

## Performance Optimization Recommendations

1. Consider optimizing smart contract gas usage through storage layout improvements and batch operations
2. WASM runtime could benefit from JIT compilation optimizations and memory pool tuning
3. AI API performance could be improved with request caching and model pre-loading
4. Database performance optimization through index tuning and connection pool adjustments recommended
5. Network performance could benefit from connection pooling and request batching optimizations
6. Overall system performance is below target - consider comprehensive profiling and bottleneck analysis
