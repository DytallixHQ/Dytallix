# QuantumVault MVP (Client Deliverable)

QuantumVault is an end-to-end MVP that:
- Scans real assets (TLS/HTTP/Postgres) and stores evidence in Postgres.
- Computes deterministic quantum-risk scores.
- Wraps secrets using PQC KEM (Kyber768) + HKDF-SHA256 + ChaCha20-Poly1305 and stores payloads in Vault.
- Anchors attestations on-chain (EVM) and records real tx hashes.

Everything lives under `QuantumVaultMVP/`.

## Quickstart (Local)

Prereqs: Docker + Docker Compose.

1) Start the full stack:

```bash
cd QuantumVaultMVP/infra
docker compose up --build
```

2) Open the UI:
- https://localhost:8443

3) Log in:
- Email: `admin@local`
- Password: `ChangeMe!12345`

Notes:
- Local TLS is self-signed; use `curl -k` for API calls.
- `Vault` is running in dev mode for the MVP stack.

## API Base

When running via `docker compose`, the API is served behind Caddy at:
- `https://localhost:8443/api`

## Acceptance Script (Not run automatically)

Once the stack is up, run:

```bash
cd QuantumVaultMVP
./scripts/acceptance.sh
```

## Repository Layout

- `backend/` Go API server (migrations, scanning, wrapping, attestations)
- `frontend/` Next.js dashboard + login
- `infra/` docker-compose stack, local TLS reverse proxy, contracts deployer
- `infra/helm/` Helm chart for backend/frontend (cluster deployment)
- `scripts/` packaging + acceptance scripts
- `docs/` architecture and operational runbooks
- `audit/` place for SBOM/audit artifacts (generated by scripts)
- `dist/` output bundles for client delivery
