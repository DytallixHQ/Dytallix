# Schema directory for CosmWasm contract

This directory will be populated with JSON schema files when you run:

```bash
cargo schema
```

The generated schema files include:
- Query and execute message schemas
- Response type schemas  
- Contract state schemas

These files are used by:
- Frontend applications for type safety
- Code generation tools
- Documentation generation
- IDE integration and autocompletion

Schema generation requires the `cosmwasm-schema` dependency which is included in the counter contract's Cargo.toml.
