3) Set up Vite dev proxy/API gateway for backend endpoints
4) Full QA pass (test flows, fix broken links, confirm wallet connect/faucet, verify AI demos)
5) Deploy to production (Netlify/Vercel/VPS) and verify live site

7) Add bug report/feedback form in Developer Resources
8) Draft announcement post for Discord/X for launch
