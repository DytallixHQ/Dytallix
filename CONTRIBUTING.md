3. **Pick an Area**: Choose a module (blockchain-core, ai-services, wallet, smart-contracts, developer-tools) that matches your skills.
4. **Start Small**: Look for TODOs, open issues, or missing stubs in `INTERFACES.md` files.
5. **Fork & Branch**: Fork the repo, create a feature branch, and make your changes.
6. **Code Style**: Write clean, commented, and testable code. Follow Rust/Python best practices.
7. **Pull Requests**: Submit PRs with clear descriptions. Reference the roadmap or issues.
8. **Review & Iterate**: Collaborate on code reviews and iterate as needed.
