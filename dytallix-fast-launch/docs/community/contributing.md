# Contribution Guide

## Workflow

1. Fork repository
2. Create feature branch `feat/<topic>`
3. Ensure lint/test pass
4. Submit PR with concise description

## Standards

- Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:, refactor:)
- Keep PRs focused (avoid >500 line mixed changes)
- Add/update docs for user-facing changes

## Code Quality

- ESLint + Prettier (auto-run pre-commit - roadmap)
- Unit tests for logic, e2e for flows
- Avoid premature optimization

## Security Disclosure

Email security@dytallix.example with detailed findings. Do not open public issues for unpatched vulnerabilities.
