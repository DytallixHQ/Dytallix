# PulseGuard Use Cases (Skeleton)

Planned templates:
- Flash Loan Exploit: detect high velocity + borrow->swap->repay chain.
- Velocity Structuring: many small repetitive transfers/mints below heuristic threshold.
- Layering: rapid multi-hop cross-venue movement.
- Bridge Laundering: bridge hop followed by fanout + mixer.
- Stablecoin Synthetic Mint/Burn: anomalous mint/burn ratio vs historical baseline.

Current implementation: only flash_loan velocity heuristic stub.
