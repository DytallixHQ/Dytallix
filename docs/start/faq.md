# FAQ

Common questions about the testnet.

> Last updated: 2025-08-20

1. **Why can't I connect?** Check RPC URL and firewall.
2. **Faucet says rate limit.** Wait 24h or use another address.
3. **Invalid transaction error.** Ensure correct chain ID and fees.
4. **Explorer shows 404.** Block not yet indexed; retry later.
5. **Node sync is slow.** Use snapshot or fast sync.
6. **What is PQC?** See [PQC Primer](../architecture/pqc-primer.md).
7. **Can I use mainnet keys?** Not recommended; generate new ones.
8. **How many validators?** See [Parameters](../architecture/parameters.md).
9. **Does token have value?** No, testnet tokens are worthless.
10. **Faucet failed with 500.** Check address format.
11. **How to reset my node?** See [Upgrades & Resets](../operators/upgrades-resets.md).
12. **Tx stuck in mempool.** Resubmit with higher gas.
13. **How to deploy contracts?** See [Smart Contracts](../developers/smart-contracts.md).
14. **Why explorer event decoding fails?** Contract not verified.
15. **Can I run on Windows?** Use WSL2.
16. **Where to report bugs?** Open an issue on GitHub with details.
17. **How to subscribe to events?** See [WebSockets & gRPC](../developers/websockets-grpc.md).
18. **Is telemetry collected?** Minimal metrics for stability.
19. **Can I reuse faucet every minute?** No, 1 request per hour.
