## 📝 Notes

### Current State Assessment
The Dytallix project has achieved **exceptional progress** with 85%+ completion across most phases. The **only major blocker** is the WASM smart contract runtime, which is preventing full Phase 3 completion.

### Critical Success Factors
- **WASM Runtime**: 60% of remaining effort should focus here
- **Frontend Development**: 25% effort for React wallet UI
- **Cross-Chain Bridges**: 15% effort for Phase 2b completion

### Risk Mitigation
- WASM runtime is the primary risk - consider parallel development approaches
- Frontend development can proceed in parallel with WASM work
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure is already in place

### Resource Allocation
- **Primary Focus**: WASM smart contract runtime completion
- **Secondary Focus**: Frontend development and cross-chain bridges
- **Maintenance**: Keep existing systems optimized and documented
