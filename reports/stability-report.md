- Start Time: (fill)
- End Time: (fill)
- Duration: (fill)

## Execution Parameters
- SOAK_DURATION_MINUTES: (fill)
- FAILURE_OUTAGE_SECONDS: (fill, default 120)
- Metrics Interval: 10s

## Summary Metrics
(Automatically appended by generate_stability_report.py)

## Block Time Distribution
- Average Block Time: (filled)
- Median Block Time: (filled)
- 95th Percentile: (TBD if added later)

## Missed Blocks
Summarize per validator, provide reasoning if any anomalies.

## TPS Over Time
Discuss throughput stability and any dips/spikes.

## Failure Drill
- Validator stopped at: (timestamp)
- Outage Duration: (seconds)
- Alert Fired: (Y/N + details)
- Recovery Height Gap: (blocks)
- Time to catch up: (seconds)

## Alerts & Monitoring
Paste or summarize relevant alert log lines.

## Raw Log Snippet
