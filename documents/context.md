# Dytallix Project Context Document

## Name  
**Dytallix**  
A secure, AI-enhanced, post-quantum cryptocurrency built for the quantum era of finance.

---

## Vision  
To create a future-proof digital asset and smart contract platform that combines **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to deliver unmatched security, fraud resistance, adaptive intelligence, and compliance readiness in a decentralized system.  

Dytallix aims to become the go-to infrastructure for **quantum-resilient DeFi**, **intelligent smart contracts**, and **secure digital asset management** in the post-2030 financial landscape.

### Cryptography (PQC)
- **Signature Algorithms**: CRYSTALS-Dilithium (primary), Falcon (optional), SPHINCS+ (backup)
- **Key Exchange**: Kyber (lattice-based)
- **Libraries**: liboqs, PQClean, OpenQuantumSafe

### AI Infrastructure
- **Modeling**: PyTorch or TensorFlow (Python for training, ONNX for deployment)
- **Deployment**: Off-chain AI service layer with secure oracle-style bridges
- **Use Cases**: Fraud detection, smart contract analysis, adaptive security, NLP-driven contract generation

### Smart Contract Layer
- **VM**: WASM-based smart contracts or optional EVM compatibility
- **Languages**: Rust, Go, Solidity
- **Tooling**: SDKs, AI-integrated libraries, simulation environments

### Frontend / Wallets
- **UI Framework**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Wallets**: Native desktop/mobile with PQC key generation + AI-integrated risk scoring
- **APIs**: GraphQL and REST for analytics and on-chain AI query
